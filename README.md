Dependencies:<br/>
```
nitrogen
rofi
xcompmgr
i3-gaps
lemonbar-xft-git
ttf-ms-fonts
python2
scrot
i3lock
Python Imaging Library
```
<br/>
<br/>
Applications that are also used but could be removed are: terminator, gksu, wicd, and pm-utils<br/>
Sox is also used to play the mp3s when the keyboard shortcuts are used, which I think is cool, but could also be removed<br/>
Also things like ping and xrandr and sed that are built in to linux systems are used<br/>
Also, you need to make the backend script executable for it to be run:<br/>
```chmod +x backend_script.sh```<br/>
I'm thinking about changing the lock script to something other than python, so that dependency might be removed<br/>
Paths will have to be changed<br/>
